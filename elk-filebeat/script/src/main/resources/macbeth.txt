<h3>SCENE II. A camp near Forres.</h3>
<i>Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant</i>

<A NAME=speech1>DUNCAN</A>
<A NAME=1.2.1>What bloody man is that? He can report,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.2>As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt</A>
<A NAME=1.2.3>The newest state.</A>

<A NAME=speech2>MALCOLM</A>
<A NAME=1.2.4>                  This is the sergeant</A>
<A NAME=1.2.5>Who like a good and hardy soldier fought</A>
<A NAME=1.2.6>'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!</A>
<A NAME=1.2.7>Say to the king the knowledge of the broil</A>
<A NAME=1.2.8>As thou didst leave it.</A>

<A NAME=speech3>Sergeant</A>
<A NAME=1.2.9>Doubtful it stood;</A>
<A NAME=1.2.10>As two spent swimmers, that do cling together</A>
<A NAME=1.2.11>And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--</A>
<A NAME=1.2.12>Worthy to be a rebel, for to that</A>
<A NAME=1.2.13>The multiplying villanies of nature</A>
<A NAME=1.2.14>Do swarm upon him--from the western isles</A>
<A NAME=1.2.15>Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;</A>
<A NAME=1.2.16>And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.17>Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:</A>
<A NAME=1.2.18>For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--</A>
<A NAME=1.2.19>Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.20>Which smoked with bloody execution,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.21>Like valour's minion carved out his passage</A>
<A NAME=1.2.22>Till he faced the slave;</A>
<A NAME=1.2.23>Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.24>Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.25>And fix'd his head upon our battlements.</A>

<A NAME=speech4>DUNCAN</A>
<A NAME=1.2.26>O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!</A>

<A NAME=speech5>Sergeant</A>
<A NAME=1.2.27>As whence the sun 'gins his reflection</A>
<A NAME=1.2.28>Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.29>So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come</A>
<A NAME=1.2.30>Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:</A>
<A NAME=1.2.31>No sooner justice had with valour arm'd</A>
<A NAME=1.2.32>Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.33>But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.34>With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men</A>
<A NAME=1.2.35>Began a fresh assault.</A>

<A NAME=speech6>DUNCAN</A>
<A NAME=1.2.36>Dismay'd not this</A>
<A NAME=1.2.37>Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?</A>

<A NAME=speech7>Sergeant</A>
<A NAME=1.2.38>Yes;</A>
<A NAME=1.2.39>As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.40>If I say sooth, I must report they were</A>
<A NAME=1.2.41>As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they</A>
<A NAME=1.2.42>Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:</A>
<A NAME=1.2.43>Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.44>Or memorise another Golgotha,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.45>I cannot tell.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.46>But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.</A>

<A NAME=speech8>DUNCAN</A>
<A NAME=1.2.47>So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;</A>
<A NAME=1.2.48>They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.</A>
<i>Exit Sergeant, attended</i>
<A NAME=1.2.49>Who comes here?</A>
<i>Enter ROSS</i>

<A NAME=speech9>MALCOLM</A>
<A NAME=1.2.50>                  The worthy thane of Ross.</A>

<A NAME=speech10>LENNOX</A>
<A NAME=1.2.51>What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look</A>
<A NAME=1.2.52>That seems to speak things strange.</A>

<A NAME=speech11>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=1.2.53>God save the king!</A>

<A NAME=speech12>DUNCAN</A>
<A NAME=1.2.54>Whence camest thou, worthy thane?</A>

<A NAME=speech13>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=1.2.55>From Fife, great king;</A>
<A NAME=1.2.56>Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky</A>
<A NAME=1.2.57>And fan our people cold. Norway himself,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.58>With terrible numbers,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.59>Assisted by that most disloyal traitor</A>
<A NAME=1.2.60>The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;</A>
<A NAME=1.2.61>Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.62>Confronted him with self-comparisons,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.63>Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.64>Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.65>The victory fell on us.</A>

<A NAME=speech14>DUNCAN</A>
<A NAME=1.2.66>Great happiness!</A>

<A NAME=speech15>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=1.2.67>That now</A>
<A NAME=1.2.68>Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:</A>
<A NAME=1.2.69>Nor would we deign him burial of his men</A>
<A NAME=1.2.70>Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch</A>
<A NAME=1.2.71>Ten thousand dollars to our general use.</A>

<A NAME=speech16>DUNCAN</A>
<A NAME=1.2.72>No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive</A>
<A NAME=1.2.73>Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.74>And with his former title greet Macbeth.</A>

<A NAME=speech17>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=1.2.75>I'll see it done.</A>

<A NAME=speech4>First Witch</A>
<A NAME=1.3.4>A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,</A>

<A NAME=2.3.134>Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,</A>

<A NAME=2.3.139>And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature</A>
<A NAME=2.3.140>For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,</A>
<A NAME=2.3.141>Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers</A>
<A NAME=2.3.142>Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,</A>

<A NAME=speech43>LADY MACBETH</A>
<A NAME=2.3.145>Help me hence, ho!</A>

<A NAME=speech44>MACDUFF</A>
<A NAME=2.3.146>Look to the lady.</A>

<A NAME=speech45>MALCOLM</A>
<A NAME=2.3.147>[Aside to DONALBAIN]  Why do we hold our tongues,</A>
<A NAME=2.3.148>That most may claim this argument for ours?</A>

<A NAME=speech46>DONALBAIN</A>
<A NAME=2.3.149>[Aside to MALCOLM]  What should be spoken here,</A>
<A NAME=2.3.150>where our fate,</A>

<i>LADY MACBETH is carried out</i>
<A NAME=2.3.157>And when we have our naked frailties hid,</A>
<A NAME=2.3.158>That suffer in exposure, let us meet,</A>
<A NAME=2.3.159>And question this most bloody piece of work,</A>
<A NAME=2.3.160>To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:</A>

<i>Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.</i>

<A NAME=speech53>MALCOLM</A>
<A NAME=2.3.169>What will you do? Let's not consort with them:</A>
<A NAME=2.3.170>To show an unfelt sorrow is an office</A>
<A NAME=2.3.171>Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.</A>

<A NAME=speech54>DONALBAIN</A>
<A NAME=2.3.172>To Ireland, I; our separated fortune</A>
<A NAME=2.3.173>Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,</A>
<A NAME=2.3.174>There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,</A>
<A NAME=2.3.175>The nearer bloody.</A>

<A NAME=speech55>MALCOLM</A>
<A NAME=2.3.176>                  This murderous shaft that's shot</A>
<A NAME=2.3.177>Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way</A>
<A NAME=2.3.178>Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;</A>
<A NAME=2.3.179>And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,</A>

<h3>SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.</h3>
<i>Enter ROSS and an old Man</i>

<A NAME=speech1>Old Man</A>
<A NAME=2.4.1>Threescore and ten I can remember well:</A>
<A NAME=2.4.2>Within the volume of which time I have seen</A>
<A NAME=2.4.3>Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night</A>
<A NAME=2.4.4>Hath trifled former knowings.</A>

<A NAME=speech2>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=2.4.5>Ah, good father,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.6>Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.7>Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.8>And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:</A>
<A NAME=2.4.9>Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.10>That darkness does the face of earth entomb,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.11>When living light should kiss it?</A>

<A NAME=speech3>Old Man</A>
<A NAME=2.4.12>'Tis unnatural,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.13>Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.14>A falcon, towering in her pride of place,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.15>Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.</A>

<A NAME=speech4>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=2.4.16>And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--</A>
<A NAME=2.4.17>Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.18>Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.19>Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make</A>
<A NAME=2.4.20>War with mankind.</A>

<A NAME=speech5>Old Man</A>
<A NAME=2.4.21>'Tis said they eat each other.</A>

<A NAME=speech6>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=2.4.22>They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes</A>
<A NAME=2.4.23>That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.</A>
<i>Enter MACDUFF</i>
<A NAME=2.4.24>How goes the world, sir, now?</A>

<A NAME=speech7>MACDUFF</A>
<A NAME=2.4.25>Why, see you not?</A>

<A NAME=speech8>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=2.4.26>Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?</A>

<A NAME=speech9>MACDUFF</A>
<A NAME=2.4.27>Those that Macbeth hath slain.</A>

<A NAME=speech10>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=2.4.28>Alas, the day!</A>
<A NAME=2.4.29>What good could they pretend?</A>

<A NAME=speech11>MACDUFF</A>
<A NAME=2.4.30>They were suborn'd:</A>
<A NAME=2.4.31>Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.32>Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them</A>
<A NAME=2.4.33>Suspicion of the deed.</A>

<A NAME=speech12>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=2.4.34>'Gainst nature still!</A>
<A NAME=2.4.35>Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up</A>
<A NAME=2.4.36>Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like</A>
<A NAME=2.4.37>The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.</A>

<A NAME=speech13>MACDUFF</A>
<A NAME=2.4.38>He is already named, and gone to Scone</A>
<A NAME=2.4.39>To be invested.</A>

<A NAME=speech14>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=2.4.40>                  Where is Duncan's body?</A>

<A NAME=speech15>MACDUFF</A>
<A NAME=2.4.41>Carried to Colmekill,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.42>The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,</A>
<A NAME=2.4.43>And guardian of their bones.</A>

<A NAME=speech16>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=2.4.44>Will you to Scone?</A>

<A NAME=speech17>MACDUFF</A>
<A NAME=2.4.45>No, cousin, I'll to Fife.</A>

<A NAME=speech18>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=2.4.46>Well, I will thither.</A>

<A NAME=speech19>MACDUFF</A>
<A NAME=2.4.47>Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!</A>

<A NAME=speech14>MACBETH</A>

<A NAME=3.2.54>And with thy bloody and invisible hand</A>
<A NAME=3.2.55>Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond</A>
<A NAME=3.2.56>Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow</A>
<A NAME=3.2.57>Makes wing to the rooky wood:</A>
<A NAME=3.2.58>Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.59>While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.60>Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;</A>

<h3>SCENE VI. Forres. The palace.</h3>
<i>Enter LENNOX and another Lord</i>

<A NAME=speech1>LENNOX</A>
<A NAME=3.6.1>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,</A>
<A NAME=3.6.2>Which can interpret further: only, I say,</A>
<A NAME=3.6.3>Things have been strangely borne. The</A>
<A NAME=3.6.4>gracious Duncan</A>
<A NAME=3.6.5>Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:</A>
<A NAME=3.6.6>And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;</A>
<A NAME=3.6.7>Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,</A>
<A NAME=3.6.8>For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.</A>
<A NAME=3.6.9>Who cannot want the thought how monstrous</A>
<A NAME=3.6.10>It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</A>
<A NAME=3.6.11>To kill their gracious father? damned fact!</A>
<A NAME=3.6.12>How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight</A>
<A NAME=3.6.13>In pious rage the two delinquents tear,</A>
<A NAME=3.6.14>That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?</A>
<A NAME=3.6.15>Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;</A>
<A NAME=3.6.16>For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive</A>
<A NAME=3.6.17>To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,</A>
<A NAME=3.6.18>He has borne all things well: and I do think</A>
<A NAME=3.6.19>That had he Duncan's sons under his key--</A>
<A NAME=3.6.20>As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they</A>
<A NAME=3.6.21>should find</A>
<A NAME=3.6.22>What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.</A>
<A NAME=3.6.23>But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd</A>
<A NAME=3.6.24>His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear</A>
<A NAME=3.6.25>Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell</A>
<A NAME=3.6.26>Where he bestows himself?</A>

<A NAME=speech2>Lord</A>
<A NAME=3.6.27>The son of Duncan,</A>
<A NAME=3.6.28>From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth</A>
<A NAME=3.6.29>Lives in the English court, and is received</A>
<A NAME=3.6.30>Of the most pious Edward with such grace</A>
<A NAME=3.6.31>That the malevolence of fortune nothing</A>
<A NAME=3.6.32>Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff</A>
<A NAME=3.6.33>Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid</A>
<A NAME=3.6.34>To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:</A>
<A NAME=3.6.35>That, by the help of these--with Him above</A>
<A NAME=3.6.36>To ratify the work--we may again</A>
<A NAME=3.6.37>Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,</A>
<A NAME=3.6.38>Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,</A>
<A NAME=3.6.39>Do faithful homage and receive free honours:</A>
<A NAME=3.6.40>All which we pine for now: and this report</A>
<A NAME=3.6.41>Hath so exasperate the king that he</A>
<A NAME=3.6.42>Prepares for some attempt of war.</A>

<A NAME=speech3>LENNOX</A>
<A NAME=3.6.43>Sent he to Macduff?</A>

<A NAME=speech4>Lord</A>
<A NAME=3.6.44>He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'</A>
<A NAME=3.6.45>The cloudy messenger turns me his back,</A>
<A NAME=3.6.46>And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time</A>
<A NAME=3.6.47>That clogs me with this answer.'</A>

<A NAME=speech5>LENNOX</A>
<A NAME=3.6.48>And that well might</A>
<A NAME=3.6.49>Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance</A>
<A NAME=3.6.50>His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel</A>
<A NAME=3.6.51>Fly to the court of England and unfold</A>
<A NAME=3.6.52>His message ere he come, that a swift blessing</A>
<A NAME=3.6.53>May soon return to this our suffering country</A>
<A NAME=3.6.54>Under a hand accursed!</A>

<A NAME=speech6>Lord</A>
<A NAME=3.6.55>I'll send my prayers with him.</A>

<A NAME=speech49>ROSS</A>
<A NAME=4.3.229>No mind that's honest</A>

<A NAME=speech62>MACDUFF</A>
<A NAME=4.3.260>I shall do so;</A>

<A NAME=4.3.274>Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,</A>

<A NAME=speech1>Doctor</A>
<A NAME=5.1.1>I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive</A>

<A NAME=speech2>Gentlewoman</A>
<A NAME=5.1.3>Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen</A>
<A NAME=5.1.4>her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon</A>
<A NAME=5.1.5>her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.6>write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again</A>
<A NAME=5.1.7>return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.</A>

<A NAME=speech3>Doctor</A>
<A NAME=5.1.8>A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once</A>
<A NAME=5.1.9>the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of</A>
<A NAME=5.1.10>watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her</A>
<A NAME=5.1.11>walking and other actual performances, what, at any</A>
<A NAME=5.1.12>time, have you heard her say?</A>

<A NAME=speech4>Gentlewoman</A>
<A NAME=5.1.13>That, sir, which I will not report after her.</A>

<A NAME=5.1.14>You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.</A>

<i>Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper</i>
<A NAME=5.1.17>Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.18>and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.</A>

<A NAME=speech7>Doctor</A>
<A NAME=5.1.19>How came she by that light?</A>

<A NAME=speech8>Gentlewoman</A>
<A NAME=5.1.20>Why, it stood by her: she has light by her</A>

<A NAME=speech9>Doctor</A>
<A NAME=5.1.22>You see, her eyes are open.</A>

<A NAME=speech10>Gentlewoman</A>
<A NAME=5.1.23>Ay, but their sense is shut.</A>

<A NAME=speech11>Doctor</A>
<A NAME=5.1.24>What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.</A>

<A NAME=speech12>Gentlewoman</A>
<A NAME=5.1.25>It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus</A>

<A NAME=speech13>LADY MACBETH</A>
<A NAME=5.1.28>Yet here's a spot.</A>

<A NAME=5.1.32>then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my</A>
<A NAME=5.1.33>lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we</A>
<A NAME=5.1.34>fear who knows it, when none can call our power to</A>

<A NAME=5.1.36>to have had so much blood in him.</A>

<A NAME=speech16>Doctor</A>
<A NAME=5.1.37>Do you mark that?</A>

<A NAME=speech17>LADY MACBETH</A>
<A NAME=5.1.38>The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--</A>
<A NAME=5.1.39>What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'</A>
<A NAME=5.1.40>that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with</A>

<A NAME=5.1.42>Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.</A>

<A NAME=speech19>Gentlewoman</A>
<A NAME=5.1.43>She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of</A>
<A NAME=5.1.44>that: heaven knows what she has known.</A>

<A NAME=speech20>LADY MACBETH</A>
<A NAME=5.1.45>Here's the smell of the blood still: all the</A>
<A NAME=5.1.46>perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little</A>
<A NAME=5.1.47>hand. Oh, oh, oh!</A>

<A NAME=speech21>Doctor</A>
<A NAME=5.1.48>What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.</A>

<A NAME=speech22>Gentlewoman</A>
<A NAME=5.1.49>I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the</A>

<A NAME=speech26>LADY MACBETH</A>

<A NAME=speech31>Doctor</A>
<A NAME=5.1.65>Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds</A>
<A NAME=5.1.66>Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds</A>
<A NAME=5.1.67>To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.68>More needs she the divine than the physician.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.69>God, God forgive us all! Look after her;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.70>Remove from her the means of all annoyance,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.71>And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.72>My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.</A>

<A NAME=5.5.2>The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength</A>

<A NAME=5.5.4>Till famine and the ague eat them up:</A>

<A NAME=5.7.13>Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword</A>
